# User Reputation System for Cloud Service Providers
This is my final year thesis work based on the use of decision tree algorithms for accurate user classification ( users here are clients to cloud service providers)

##Problem Statement
Cloud has moved beyond the promise of cost savings. As a result, we need to consider the perspective of cloud service providers and not just what the end user or client needs. 
>When a cloud service provider recieves similar resuource requests from multiple clients, on what basis will resource scheduling take place? 
How will the service provider decide which user deserves to be allocated those requested resources?
